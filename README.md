# Mushroom-Challenge


Dr. Michael Thompson, head of the Department of Biology at the Highshire University, has contacted us for help. 
He wants to develop a smartphone application that, given some attributes of a mushroom taken with a picture, can tell to users if it is an edible specie or a poisonous one. 

Attached to this email you will find a csv file with the information collected by his Department, as well as a text file (info_mushroom.txt) with additional information about this dataset.
Your task will consist in developing the best model possible to determine the class of a mushroom (edible or poisonous) taking into account its characteristics. 

There are  rules for this challenge:

1)-If your model predicts any “poisson” mushroom classified as “edible” you will lose the challenge.

2)-If your model use features which can't be extracted from a picture of a smartphone you lose the challenge.

3)-Your models should be able to process a blind set and to provide a prediction
